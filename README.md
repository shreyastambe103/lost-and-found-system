#  Smart Lost & Found Management System 

Welcome to the **Smart Lost & Found Management System** â€” a simple, clean, and efficient digital platform designed to help students and staff report, search, and claim lost items on campus with ease!

## Project Overview

On college campuses, misplaced personal belongings like ID cards, wallets, electronics, and stationery are a common problem. The traditional lost-and-found processes are usually informal, disorganized, and inconvenient. 

This project aims to solve that by providing a **modern, user-friendly, and transparent web-based platform** where lost items can be logged, browsed, and claimed securely using an OTP-based verification process.
